Care and feeding of the SMS server:

There is a log of all SMS server activity to /u1/sms/sms.log; doing a
"tail -f /u1/sms/sms.log" will let you know what's going on with the
server right now.

The format of each line of the log file is usually:

{some date} <pid> smsd[#conn-id]: message

where  {some date} is the date at which the message was logged
<pid> is the process ID of the SMS server
[#conn-id] is the connection id the server is currently working on, and
"message" is a message the daemon felt like printing.

You may also see errors of the form
INGRES ERROR #xxxxx blah blah blah.

If you see one of these, call a guru; they should not happen.

The conn-id field is a serial number for each connection so that you
can figure out which client requested a particular action logged in
the log; all connects, disconnects, and requests are logged, as are
some other things (for debugging purposes).  It starts with zero and
goes up by one for each new connection.

To stop the daemon, send it a SIGTERM or SIGHUP.

	kill -HUP pid

To restart the daemon, run /u1/sms/bin/startsms.
