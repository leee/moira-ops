This directory contains stuff necessary to create and initialize an
sms database.  Note that some other directories rely on files here
(notably dbbuild), and that the newsms program relies on other files.

STEPS TO CREATE A DATABASE:

1. run "createdb" from the shell
2. run the quel commands in newdb to create the tables
3. run newsms
4. if you want any queries to be publically executable, change their
   capacls entries from list_id 2 to 1.
5. run the quel commands in dbopt to create indices on the data.

Example:

    createdb testsms
    quel testsms
	    \i newdb
	    \g
	    \q
    newsms
	    mar

	    19000
	    19000
	    600
	    mar
    quel testsms
	    \i dbopt
	    \g
	    \q
    renamedb testsms newsms


THINGS TO DO:

automate generation of stub procs in newsms.qc
