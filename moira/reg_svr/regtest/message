      Welcome to the Fall '89 Project Athena Registration Test.

If you can find a free workstation, please use the "Click here to
register for an account" button on xlogin.  If you are already logged
in to your workstation, in an xterm that is at least 24x80 characters
large, first do "access_on", then enter the command "rlogin [your
workstation] -l register", then the password "athena" when it prompts
for it (please use rlogin and not telnet so that the TERMCAP
environment variable gets set).

Please note the time when you start.  Follow the screen prompts for
the registration.  You should be registering as:



Choose whatever username and password you like.  Please answer the
following questions when you are done, and return the form to E40-331.
If you did "access_on" earlier, you will want to execute "access_off"
now.

Thank you,
					-Mark Rosenstein
