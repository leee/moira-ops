Good.  Your password was re-typed correctly, and has been recorded.
YOU MUST NOT FORGET YOUR PASSWORD.  Once you have your account, you
can change your password whenever you like.  We strongly recommend
that you change it at least once a semester, and whenever you think
that someone else may have learned it.

You're done now.  You are registered to get an Athena account.  Your
account should be created and ready to use by tomorrow.  Please remember
your username of "%s" and the password you typed in earlier.

Thank you, and welcome to Athena!
