You need to invent a secret password to keep your work on Athena secure and
private.  Make it easy to remember, but one that others won't easily guess;
so don't use your name, or your dog's name, or a word from the dictionary.
You'll be able to change your password whenever you like.
Passwords should be at least 6 characters long, and may contain UPPER- and
lower-case letters, numbers, or punctuation.  A good password can be:
   -- some initials, like "GykoR-66" for "Get your kicks on Rte 66."
   -- an easily pronounced nonsense word, like "slaRooBey" or "krang-its"
   -- a mis-spelled phrase, like "2HotPeetzas" or "ItzAGurl"
To help keep your new password secret, you won't see it while you're typing,
so be sure to type carefully.
