Your password is your protection against other people accidentally or
intentionally damaging your files or reading your personal mail.
Choose as a password something easy for you to remember, but that
people who know you won't easily guess.  Don't use a word found in the
dictionary, because someone may run a program that tries all those
words.  That same program will probably try the names of all known
comic-strip characters, rock bands, etc.  Please do not let anyone
else, including friends, know your password.  DON'T FORGET YOUR
PASSWORD.  You may change your password at any time once you have your
account.
