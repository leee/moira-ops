Your username is the name you give to the computer to tell it who you
are; it will also be used by friends and colleagues to communicate on
the computer.  No two people may have the same name.  Most people
choose a username which is similar to their real name.  A username is
restricted to a maximum of 8 characters (a minimum of 3) and must be
all lowercase characters.
