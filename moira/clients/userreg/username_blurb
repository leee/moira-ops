Each time you begin working on Athena, you tell it who you are by typing
your USERNAME.  Friends, colleagues, and others will use your username
to send you messages on Athena.

A username must be at least 3 characters, and not more than 8, and must be
all lowercase letters or numbers.  No two people may have the same username.
(After you select one, we'll check to make sure.)

We suggest the username "%s", but you may make up another one instead.
(Most people choose a username which is similar to their real name.)
