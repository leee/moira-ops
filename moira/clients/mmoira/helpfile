*no_more_help
Sorry, no further help is available.
*show_user
This will display information about a user in the database.  The user
may or may not have an active account.

Users may be retrieved in four ways:
+ by login name (may use wildcards)
+ by Unix UID (must match exactly)
+ by first and/or last names (may use wildcards)
+ by class (please do not specify a class with too many people in it)

Fill in the desired field(s), mouse on "OK", and moira will retrieve
any matching users.  Moira will look to see which field(s) you
filled in, and perform one of the for retrievals mentioned above.
*add_user
Specify all of the information to add a new user to the database.  The
user need not have an active useraccount.

+ specify a login name of 3 to 8 characters, or the special value
  "create unique login" to have moira choose one for you
+ specify a number for the UID, or the special value "create unique UID"
  to have moira choose one for you.
+ Moira has a set of standard capitalization rules it uses on users'
  real names.  If you attempt to enter names capitalized differently,
  Moira will complain.  You may override this, but if you do so, the
  register program may not work for that user.
+ the ID number will be one-way encrypted before being stored in the
  database.  If you wish to enter the encrypted ID directly, enclose
  it in double-quotes.
+ to create a fully active user account, enter a user here as status
  "Registerable", then use the "register" option on the "user" menu to
  complete the user account.
*register_user
This will turn an entry for a user in the database to a fully
functioning account.  The user may be selected in two ways:

+ specify the real name of the user (with wildcards allowed) in the
  first name and last name fields.  This must match only one user in
  the database.
+ specify the unix UID of the desired user.

Be sure to fill in a login name which is not in use.  The suggested
name is
  first initial, middle initial, first six characters of last name
but must be eight or fewer characters long.
*select_user
Specify the login name of the user to be modified.  Wildcards may
be used, but your specification must match exactly one user.
*mod_user
Change any fields desired, then mouse on "OK" to modify the user
entry.  You may even change the login name.

+ You may change the UID to the special value "create unique UID"
  to have moira choose another one for you.
+ Moira has a set of standard capitalization rules it uses on users'
  real names.  If you attempt to enter names capitalized differently,
  Moira will complain.  You may override this, but if you do so, the
  register program may not work for that user.
+ the ID number will be one-way encrypted before being stored in the
  database.  To enter an already encrypted ID, type double-quotes (")
  around it.
+ If you are just changing the account status, in the future remember
  that the "deactivate" choice of the "user" menu is a quick way to
  set the status to "3 - Deleted".
*deactivate_user
Specify the login name of the user to be deactivated.

Deactivating a user makes their account no longer usable.  They will
show up with an account status of "3 - Marked for Deletion".  However,
all of their information will still be in the database so that the
account can be turned back on if necessary.  Since they are still in
the database, their login name and UID may not be re-used.  You may
wish to make the user's group list no longer active and deny access to
their locker at the same time.

At some point in the future, deactivated accounts should be expunged,
either in bulk or with the "expunge" option of the "user" menu.
*expunge_user
Specify the login name of the user to be expunged.

This will remove the user's record from the Moira database (but not
from Kerberos).  Once this is done, the login name and UID may be
reused.  It is a good idea to leave users in the deactivated state for
a while before expunging them so that the name and ID are not reused
right away, and the account can be reactivated if necessary.

At Project Athena, we have decided that expunging individual accounts
is a bad idea, so any account which has ever been active may not be
expunged this way.  These accounts must be removed in bulk by the
Moira administrator.
*show_finger
Specify a login name to select a user whose finger information will be
displayed.  This information will exist for users whose accounts are
not yet active, as it is loaded at the same time as the users
themselves.
*select_finger
Specify the login name of the user whose finger information is to be
modified.  Wildcards may be used, but your specification must match
exactly one user.
*mod_finger
Enter the new information about the user.  This information will
appear where the finger program can see it.  

You may set your name as it appears to other users to anything you
want.  Please keep it something resembling your real name.  Our
operations staff can find out the real name of the owner of an
account.

The rest of the information is optional, and is initialized to
information from the administration.  If you do not want this
information to appear for you, type spaces over it.  Please do not
enter incorrect information.

Note that commas (,) and colons (:) are not allowed in these
responses.  This is due to how the information is manipulated later.
We suggest that you use a semicolon (;) to separate parts of your
address.
*select_pobox
Enter the login name of a user to see what that user's P. O. Box or
mail forwarding is set to.
*set_pobox
This allows you to set where a user receives their mail.  Specify the
login name to select a user.

+ If the type is POP, then the user will receive their mail on a post
  office (POP) server.  Select one of the POP servers listed below.
+ If the type is SMTP, then the user will have their mail forwarded
  somewhere else.  Type the destination address in the "SMTP Address"
  field.
+ If the type is NONE, the user will be unable to recieve mail.  This
  is the same as deleting the P. O. Box.

Note that if the user has had their mail forwarded, and wants to
recieve it locally again, you should not use this form; select the
"reset" option from the "pobox" menu to select the same POP server
that they previously used.

To add new POP servers to the list, add them as POP servers in the
servers submenu of the updates menu.
*reset_pobox
This option will change a user's mail setting to receiving on a local
POP server.  The server chosen will be the same one that the user has
used in the past.  If the user is already receiving their mail
locally, or has never had a POP box, then you will get an error.  Use
the "set" option of the "pobox" menu for more general mail
manipulation.
*del_pobox
If you delete a user's P. O. Box, they will not be able to receive
mail.  This normally should not be done.  To go ahead and delete a
users mailbox, enter their login name.
*show_krbmap
This will display user to kerberos principal mappings.  You may
specify the mappings to be displayed by entering a login name, a
principal name, or both.  Either field may contain wildcards.
*add_krbmap
This will add a new user to kerberos mapping to the database.  You
must fill in both fields, entering a login name and a kerberos
principal.

Note that the principal is case sensitive, and should be entered with
the realm in uppercase.  If the principal name contains a periods or
at-signs other than as separators between the name, instance and
realm, be sure to escape them with backslashes (\).
*del_krbmap
This will remove a mapping from the database.  You must fill in both
fields, exactly matching an existing kerberos mapping.

Note that the principal is case sensitive, and should be entered with
the realm in uppercase.  If the principal name contains a periods or
at-signs other than as separators between the name, instance and
realm, be sure to escape them with backslashes (\).
*show_machine
This will show you the information about one or more machines (hosts)
in the database.  Wildcards may be used in the name.  If no wildcards
are used, the name you type will be canonicalized by the domain name
system before being looked up in the database.  To bypass this
canonicalization, put the name inside a pair of double-quotes.  All
machine name comparisons are case-insensitive.
*add_machine
This will add a new machine (host) to the database.  The name you type
will be canonicalized by the domain name system.  To bypass this
canonicalization, put the name inside a pair of double-quotes.  Each
machine must be of one of the defined types.

Note that type "AFS" is used with pseudo-machines that are used as AFS
cellname indicators.
*select_machine
Enter the name of the machine (host) to modify or delete.  Wildcards
may be used in the name.  If no wildcards are used, the name you type
will be canonicalized by the domain name system before being looked up
in the database.  To bypass this canonicalization, put the name inside
a pair of double-quotes.  All machine name comparisons are
case-insensitive.
*mod_machine
You may change the name and/or type of the machine.  The name you type
will be canonicalized by the domain name system.  To bypass this
canonicalization, put the name inside a pair of double-quotes.  Each
machine must be of one of the defined types.

Note that type "AFS" is used with pseudo-machines that are used as AFS
cellname indicators.
*authors
This moira client was written by Mark Rosenstein and Andy Oakland of
MIT Project Athena.
*about_moira
Moira is a system configuration manager for distributed systems.  This
program is the user interface part of the system, and allows you to
manipulate everything moira knows about.

The top menu bar lists the kinds of things moira knows about, and
clicking the mouse on one of them will display a menu of operations
supported for that kind of object.  Some of these menus have submenus
for related objects.

When you select a menu item, a form will be displayed.  Fill out any
desired parts of the form:
 + put the correct value in any text fields
 + click on the appropriate choice in keyword fields
 + click on the value to toggle booleans between True and False
 + typing TAB will forward you to the next field
When you are done, click the mouse on "OK".  If you are retrieving
information from the database, the results will be displayed in the
window underneath the form.  Each form has a help message specific to
that form that you can see by clicking the mouse on "HELP".  If you
click on "CANCEL", the form will disappear without doing anything.
*add_new_value
This will allow you to add a new keyword which can be specified for
the field in the previous form.  Moira type fields are checked against
a list of legal values, but this list itself can easily be changed.
However, this should not be done lightly.  Be sure you know what you
are doing and really want this new value before adding it.

To have a keyword value removed, ask the Moira system administrator.
*wildcards
Wildcards are allowed in most fields when looking things up in the
database.  Asterisk "*" will match zero or more characters, so that
"Rose*" will match "Rose", "Rosen", "Rosenberg" or "Rosenstein".

Be careful about using wildcards where your query will match too much
data in the database.  You probably do not want to retrieve 1000
items, and doing so will cause the server to take a long time and
possibly require more resources than are available.
*del_all_member
This will allow you to remove a particular member from all lists that
member belongs to.  You may specify any type of member, but must
exactly match that member without wildcards.

This program can prompt you for each deletion, or simply do them all.
*del_mem_confirm
If you answer yes, this member will be deleted from the named list.
Answer no to avoid the deletion.  In either case, you will continue to
be prompted with the other lists the member belongs to.
*mouse
You may also retrieve or modify objects by using the mouse to click on
them where they appear in the log window.  Regular mouse clicks will
do selections as they do in most X applications.  But if you hold down
SHIFT and click the first moust button, it will retrieve the
referenced object.  And if you hold down SHIFT and click the second
mouse button, it will pull up the window to modify the referenced
object.  If you click the mouse on something the program doesn't
recognize as an object, it will beep at you.

For example, when you show information about a filesystem, a paragraph
is added to the log that starts with "Filesystem: foo".  If you click
on the name (foo in the example), it will reference that filesystem
again.  The paragraph about the filesystem also mentions a machine, a
user (the owner), a group (the owners), and another user (who last
modified the info).  You can click on any of these names to select the
object being referred to.
*keyboard
There are keyboard accelerators for many of the mouse actions.

For chosing items from the menubar, if you hold down META and type the
letter which is underlined in each word, you will select that menu.
Then typing the letter underlined in any of the items in the menu will
select that item.

When you are filling out a form, ENTER will advance you to the next
field if there is more than one field in the form.  If there is only
one field, ENTER is equivalent to mousing on OK.  ^C in a form is the
same as mousing on CANCEL.
*bugs
Please report bugs in this program by sending email to:
                     bug-moira@mit.edu 
Please be sure to mention what kind of computer you were running it
on, and any other necessary information so that we can repeat the bug
before we fix it.
*save_log
Enter a file name here, and the current contents of the log file will
be written out to that file.
*fixcase
It is important that names in the Moira database all follow the same
capitalization style so that the register program can find users.  So
even though for a few names it may not look right, we strongly suggest
that you follow what this program suggests.
*confirm_del_all
If you answer yes, this member will be deleted from the named list.\n\
Answer no to avoid the deletion.  In either case, you will continue to\n\
be prompted with the other lists the member belongs to.
*show_filsys
This will display information about a filesystem.  The filesystem may
be of any protocol type and may be a filesystem group or multiple
filesystem entry as well.

Filesystems may be retireved in any of four ways:
+ by the name of the filesystem (may use wildcards)
+ by the name of the fileserver (machine) (must match exactly)
+ by the actual partition of an NFS server (specify machine and
  partition, both must match exactly)
+ by the owning group of the filesystem (must match exactly)

Fill in the desired field(s), click on "OK", and moira will retrieve
any matching filesystems.  Moira will look to see which field(s) you
filled in, and perform one of the for retrievals mentioned above.
