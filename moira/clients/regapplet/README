How to build:

add java (and sipb if you don't already have that added)

[compiling the java code]
  setenv CLASSPATH `pwd`
  javac mit/*/*.java
  javac regapplet/*.java

[obfuscating the java bytecode]
  setenv CLASSPATH /mit/moiradev/java/klassmaster.zip
  java klassmaster

    in the "Select Package Directories" window, make sure
    clients/regapplet is selected, and click ">>", then "OK".

    Choose "Tools" -> "Obfuscate names"

    Click "change package names below:" and type "." in its text box.
    Click "don't change main class name" and choose "regapplet/Regapplet"
    Click "add corrupt symbolic entries" and choose "light corruption"

    Click "OK".

    Wait for it to finish, then choose "File" -> "Save all". Save into
    the current directory.

    choose "File" -> "Exit".

[building the zip file and cleaning up]
  zip -0 regclasses.zip z1/*/*.class z2/*.class

  rm -rf z?
  rm mit/*/*.class regapplet/*.class ChangeLog
