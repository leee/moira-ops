This is the beta test version of Moira (version 2.0).  See the
document doc/install for building and installation instructions.
Contents of this distribution:

backup: source to smsbackup & smsrestore.  Depends on files in ~/db

bin: `make install' will put binaries here that are only used on the
	sms server machine, not needed on clients.  This should be a
	duplicate of /u1/sms/bin on the sms machine.

clients: contains subdirs with source to each of the client programs

db: Database code: scripts and programs to create a database

dbck: database consistency checker

dcm: the Data Control Manager

doc: Documentation.  There are a few smaller documents in this
	directory.  the tech_plan subdirectory contains the most
	detailed document on the design and operation of moira.

et: Sources to com_err stuff.  This is a private copy so that the
	com_err() routine supports printf style arguments.

gdb: Noah Mendelsohn's GDB library (which forms the core of our RPC
	mechanism)  This is a private copy because the startup
	negotiation is different.  This directory also contains
	documentation on the GDB library.

gen: server config file generators.  These are the programs that
	extract info from the database.  The shell scripts that
	install the files are also here.

include: include files.  Has soft links to header files in other dirs.
	Reference include/foo.h as <foo.h>, and add a -I../include in 
	your Makefiles.

lib: Random libraries, including an improved version of malloc which does 
	"scribble checking" to verify that you aren't trashing your address
	space.  This dir includes soft-links to files in other dirs.

man: man pages for SMS programs

reg_svr: the daemon to handle the back end of user registration

regtape: a program to read the tape from the registrar's office

rpc: The code for the RPC mechanism: libsms.a is built here.

server: smsd & libsmsglue.a come from here.

ss: sources to libss.a, the line parser used by smstest.

test: smstest

update: Routines for performing updates to servers (including its own
	GDB-based RPC).
