README file for creating Moira

This is the root directory of MIT Project Athena's Moira service
management system source code.

The Makefiles are set up so that the source tree can be
separate from the tree(s) containing binaries.  We have
found this useful since we have to have separate sets of binaries,
for the IBM RTPC and Vaxstation II machines.

The default value of the root of the Moira source tree
(this directory) is /mit/moiradev/src.  You can set it
to something else by specifying, for example, "make SRCDIR=/x/y/z"
if you want the source in /x/y/z.

Here are the steps for building the Moira source.

1.  Create a directory to hold the tree of object files,
    say it's /foo/bar/baz.

2.  Cd to that directory and run the command:

	make -f /x/y/z/util/makeconfig SRCDIR=/x/y/z

    where /x/y/z is the root of the source tree (not necessary
    if the root is /mit/moiradev/src).  This creates the necessary
    directories and copies Makefiles into them.

3.  Cd to util/imake.includes.  Read through config.Imakefile, turning
    on appropriate flags for your installation.  Change SRCTOP appropriately.

4.  Still in the top of the object directory (/foo/bar/baz
    of Step 1), type "make world" (or "make world  SRCDIR=/x/y/z).

5.  Run "make install".  You may want to check that programs
    are installed where you want.  Then add the appropriate
    directories to your PATH environment variable.
