chpobox \- change where user receives mail
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B chpobox
[ -d|a address] [-u username]
.SH DESCRIPTION
This command adds a new mailbox, deletes and existing mailbox, or
lists the mailboxes currently assigned to
.IR username
(your own name by default).
If neither the
.B -a
or the
.B -d
option is given, the current mailboxes will be displayed.  
The options will attempt to add or delete the specified mailbox.  
A mailbox address is of the form
.I string@hostname,
where the string is usually the username, and the hostname is the name
of the machine the user wishes to receive mail on.
.PP
.B chpobox
will determine if the mailbox is of type POP, LOCAL, or FOREIGN based
on information in the SMS database, and then make the appropriate
change in the SMS database.
It will not allow a user to have more than one mailbox of type POP,
and it will not allow a user to delete his last mailbox.
The actual change will take place a couple of hours later. 
Users may only change their own information unless they are
SMS database administrators.
