.SH NAME
smstest \- perform SMS operations manually
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B smstest
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I smstest
allows one to perform by hand all operations allowed in the sms
protocol.  There are no command line options, as commands are given to
a prompt within the program.  Control operations are:
.TP
.B connnect
make a network connection to the SMS server.
.TP
.B disconnect
break the network connection to the SMS server.
.TP
.B script inputfile [outputfile]
read commands from 
.I inputfile.  If
.I outputfile is specified, output will be redirected there while
commands are read from
.I inputfile.
.TP
.B list_requests
lists all of the 
.I smstest commands.
.TP
.B quit
exits the program.
.PP
SMS protocol operations include:
.TP
.B noop
does "no operation" to the server, just making sure the server is
still there.
.TP
.B auth
sends
.I Kerberos
tickets to the server to authenticate the user.
.TP
.B query query_handle [query arguments ...]
performs a query operation on the server.  All of the real work is
done in queries.  There are over 100 queries, each of which requires
different arguments.  the arguments should be placed on the line
following the name of the query, separated by whitespace.
.TP
.B access query_handle [query arguements ...]
performs an authorization check on a query without actually executing
the query.  The arguments are the same as those in the
.B query
command described above.
.SH BUGS
There is no way to enter whitespace into a string argument to a query.

and their arguements, and a description of the protocol this
implements.
